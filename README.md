# Chatterer

This is an app that will chatter. Chatter chatter chatter. I guess I want it to connect to webpage and pull their content, and to be able to interact with APIs, and to provide a channel for people to chat through, possibly as a tunnel.

I'll likely build some google API calls into it to get it up and running first.

Honestly I just wanted to make something with http and channels to see what I could do and it exploded.
